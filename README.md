# Speech Recognition System
Python based speech to text conversion.

## Problem statement:
To understand speech given by user, convert them to text and open the mentioned website in user's default browser.

## Description:
The AI app uses speech recognition technology to convert spoken words into text format. The built-in microphone that can pick up the user's voice and send the audio data to the speech recognition algorithm. The code uses various techniques, such as signal processing, machine learning, and pattern recognition to convert the audio into text.
Once the text is extracted, the app identifies the website mentioned in the user's speech.

The app then uses browser automation technology to open the website mentioned by the user automatically. The automation technology uses computer vision techniques to locate and interact with the browser interface, allowing the app to type the website's URL and open it.

## Procedure:
* **Data Collection:** The first step is to collect audio data that will be used to train the speech recognition model. The audio data can be in the form of audio recordings or live audio input.
* **Feature Extraction:** Once the audio data has been collected, the next step is to extract relevant features from it. 
* **Model Training:** After the features have been extracted, they are used to train a machine learning model.
* **Speech Recognition:** Once the model has been trained, it can be used to recognize speech in new audio input. 
* **Error Correction:** The final step is to correct any errors in the text transcription. 

## Applications:
* **Virtual assistants:** Voice recognition technology is used to develop virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and others. 
* **Dictation software:** Voice recognition technology is used to develop dictation software that converts spoken words into text. This is particularly useful for individuals with disabilities or those who find typing difficult.
* **Customer service:** Voice recognition technology is used in call centers to automate customer service interactions.
* **Language translation:** Voice recognition technology is used in language translation applications to convert spoken words from one language into another. This is particularly useful for individuals traveling to foreign countries or for businesses operating in global markets.
* **Automotive industry:** Voice recognition technology is used in the automotive industry to develop systems that allow drivers to control various functions of their vehicle using their voice. This includes controlling the radio, air conditioning, and navigation systems.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, voice recognition is a critical application of AI that enables machines to understand and interpret human speech.
It has numerous practical applications in various industries, including virtual assistants, dictation software, customer service, language translation, and the automotive industry. 
As AI technology continues to improve, we can expect voice recognition to become even more advanced, accurate, and versatile, enabling machines to interact with humans in increasingly natural and intuitive ways.
